# JUKEreactBox is built on a react drum machine tutorial [BAWA-Drum-Machine](https://github.com/troutman21/Drum-Machine-Complete)
You can see the BAWA in action with the master branch, jukebox branch is where the action is now)

# Getting started
## Node:
[Node](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) and [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/) are two tools that we will need to run our Javascript application. You can download them both [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). You can check to see if you already have Node downloaded on your machine by typing into the terminal or command prompt `node -v`. If this command returns a version number you are all set!

## Text editor:
To get the most out of your time on this project you or your pair programming partner should work in some sort of text editor. There are a ton of good options out there, but all the cool kids use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) ðŸ˜‰.

## Getting the code/application on your computer:
* If you are familiar with Git, feel free to clone this repository to your machine like normal.
* If you are not familiar with Git (totally understandable), follow the steps below.
  1. Click on the green "Clone or Download" drop down menu in the upper right hand corner.
  2. Click the "Download Zip" button.
  3. Unzip that file and open it up in your favorite text editor.

* Next, navigate to the location of your unzipped file in your terminal/command prompt using the `cd` command.
* Then run the following commands
  * ### `npm install`
  * ### `npm start`
